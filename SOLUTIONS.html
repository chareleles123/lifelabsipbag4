    <div class="paragraph2">Women continue to face serious challenges as a result of discriminatory laws and practices. Equality has not been achieved in any country, and vows to end discriminatory laws have not been maintained.
        Women are not given enough opportunities to rise to positions of leadership since present leadership development programs do not even allow them to begin. 
        Fixing this problem is an essential imperative for all of us - not only because it’s simply the right thing to do, but also pushing women into leadership roles is one of the most valuable ways organizations can develop the leaders they’ll need for the future work. 
        The goal of the mission was established to step up efforts to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls around the world. Everyone gains when more women are given the opportunity to lead. 
        Decades of research show that women executives promote efficiency, collaboration, organizational dedication and justice.
        Subsidisation for campaigns; for its community to progressively grow larger for women to join, and would be much more of an opportunity for women to stand against these discriminations that are directed towards them. Solidairization for women, to come in unity together for the good of all to give an end to these issues and problems prior to men’s misogyny, ranging from the medieval times up until now. 
        Supporting these issues through campaigns is what should be prioritized nowadays for its importance. 
         Developing educational programs that protect women’s rights and having a campaign that women can also lead. <br>
